<h1>Dear Mom and Dad,</h1>

<br>

<p>Happy anniversary. I am so blessed to have been raised by two
amazing people. Your love for each other and for this entire family has
shaped me into the man I am today. Thank you for creating a home filled
with happiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Every day, I see
more and more of you both in me; every day, I see more and more of how
everything you have done for me - both what I knew and didn't know
about - has had such a major impact on my life. You are the models in
my life of hard work, dedication, and love. I hope you're listening to
the
song that's playing right now - It's called "Two People Fell In Love",
by Brad Paisley. One particular set of lyrics stands out to me:</p>


<blockquote>"Every single choice we make<br>
Every breath we get to take<br>
Is all because two people fell in love"
</blockquote>


I am so lucky that two amazing people fell in love. I wouldn't be who I
am
today if you hadn't been there for me every day. I love you both, and
miss you tons.&nbsp;<br>


<p>Love - Now, Always, and Forever, </p>

<p>Zach </p>

<p>P.S. I hope this is more meaningful than a card.</p>
